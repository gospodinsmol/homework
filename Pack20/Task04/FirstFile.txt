Use the FileInfo class for typical operations such as copying, moving, renaming, creating, opening, deleting, and appending to files.

If you are performing multiple operations on the same file, it can be more efficient to use FileInfo instance methods instead of the corresponding static methods of the File class, because a security check will not always be necessary.

Many of the FileInfo methods return other I/O types when you create or open files. You can use these other types to further manipulate a file. For more information, see specific FileInfo members such as Open, OpenRead, OpenText, CreateText, or Create.
